What are the common security issues in JavaScript and how can they be mitigated?
Answer: Common security issues in JavaScript include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and insecure data storage. Mitigations involve:

XSS: Sanitize user inputs, use Content Security Policy headers, and encode user-generated content.

CSRF: Use anti-CSRF tokens, validate and sanitize inputs on the server side.
Insecure data storage: Use secure mechanisms for storing sensitive data, such as HTTPS, secure cookies, and encrypted databases.


Explain the Same-Origin Policy in the context of JavaScript security.
Answer: The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security measure in web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This policy prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data across different origins. To work around SOP, developers can use techniques like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or JSONP.
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' cdn.example.com;


What is the importance of HTTPS in securing web applications, and how does it work?
Answer: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is essential for securing data transmission between a user’s browser and a website. It encrypts the data using SSL/TLS, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. HTTPS ensures the integrity and confidentiality of user data. To implement HTTPS, a website needs an SSL/TLS certificate, which verifies the site’s identity and enables secure communication.
