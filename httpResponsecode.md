HTTP status codes are standardized responses provided by a server in response to a client's request. These codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed or encountered an error. Here are some common HTTP status code categories and their meanings:

1xx Informational:

100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and is awaiting the rest.
101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.
2xx Success:

200 OK: The request has succeeded. Typically returned for GET or POST requests.
201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a result.
204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request but does not need to return any content.
3xx Redirection:

301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect): The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.
304 Not Modified: The client's cached copy is still valid, so the server doesn't need to send a new response.
4xx Client Error:

400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found at the server.
5xx Server Error:

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message, given when no more specific message is suitable.
501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.
HTTP status codes provide crucial information to both developers and users about the success or failure of a request. They help diagnose issues, guide troubleshooting efforts, and allow systems to react appropriately to different scenarios encountered during communication between clients and servers.
